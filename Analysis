Include 3 observations about the results of the study. 
Use the visualizations you generated from the study data as the basis for your observations.

1. In the analysis the drug Capomulin outperformed the other drugs in tumor volume  reduction, survival rate, and 
lower metastatic site occurrences. Capomulin was able to have a significant decrease in the tumor volume over time 
compared to the other drugs and placebo. Capomulin had a lower number of metastatic sites which is testate to the 
above average survival rate during the treatment. 


2. Influbinol was a drug that had a lower number of metastatic sites over time compared to Ketapril and the Placebo. 
However, Infubinol had the worst survival rate during the treatment which leads me to understand that this may be 
the worst drug to give for prolonging life. 


3. Ketapril was also a drug that I would not recommend. The drug made insignificant changes over the long term of taking 
the drug and was closely trailing the Placebo. In a short 5 day period it can reduce metastatic sites over time however 
in the long term it is the worst performing drug and I dont think it should be given to anyone since the placebo almost 
outperformed the drug in all categories.
